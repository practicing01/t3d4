//This file implements game mode logic for an Example gamemode. The primary functions:
//ExampleGameMode::onMissionStart
//ExampleGameMode::onMissionReset
//ExampleGameMode::onMissionEnd
//Are the primary hooks for the server to start, restart and end any active gamemodes
//onMissionStart, for example is called from core/clientServer/scripts/server/levelLoad.cs
//It's called once the server has successfully loaded the level, and has parsed
//through any active scenes to get GameModeNames defined by them. It then iterates
//over them and calls these callbacks to envoke gamemode behaviors. This allows multiple
//gamemodes to be in effect at one time. Modules can implement as many gamemodes as you want.
//
//For levels that can be reused for multiple gammodes, the general setup would be a primary level file
//with the Scene in it having the main geometry, weapons, terrain, etc. You would then have subScenes that
//each contain what's necessary for the given gamemode, such as a subScene that just adds the flags and capture
//triggers for a CTF mode. The subscene would then have it's GameModeName defined to run the CTF gamemode logic
//and the levelLoad code will execute it.
